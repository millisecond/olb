## Changelog

### [v1.5.0](https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/releases/tag/v1.5.0) - 7 Jun 2017

#### Breaking Changes

 * Support for the deprecated `proxy.addr` format `:port;certfile;keyfile;cafile` has been dropped. 
   Please use instead `proxy.addr` in combination with a
   [certificate store](https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/wiki/Features#certificate-stores).

#### Bug Fixes

#### Improvements

 * Upgrade to go1.8.3

 * [Issue #133](https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/issues/133): websockets failing with 500 on rancher

   Rancher is a Java application which uses `java.net.URL` to compose
   the original request URL from the `X-Forwarded-Proto` and other
   headers. The `java.net.URL` class does not support the `ws` or `wss`
   protocol without a matching `java.net.URLStreamHandler`
   implementation. Java code should use the `java.net.URI` class for
   these types of URLs instead. However, the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header
   isn't specified as the `Forwarded` header ([RFC
   7239](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7239#section-5.4)) and the
   common usage is to only use either `http` or `https` for websocket
   connections. In order not to break existing applications fabio now
   sets the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header to `http` for `ws` and to `https`
   for `wss` connections.

 * [PR #292](https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/pull/292): Add unique request id

   fabio can now add a unique request id in form of a UUIDv4 to each request as a header.
   The name of the header is configurable and the value of the header can be logged
   to the access log.

   Thanks to @bkmit for this patch.

 * [Issue #249](https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/issues/249): Make TLS version and cipher suites configurable

   fabio now allows to configure the TLS parameters for the handshake as part of the
   `proxy.addr` configuration. See `fabio.properties` for details.

 * [Issue #280](https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/issues/280): Add protocol data to `Forwarded` header

   fabio adds `httpproto`, `tlsver` and `tlsciphers` to the `Forwarded` header.

 * [Issue #290](https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/issues/290): Add profiling support

   fabio now supports optional memory, cpu, mutex and block (contention) profiling.
   Profiling is enabled through the `profile.mode` flag which determines the mode.
   The `profile.path` flag determines the output path.

 * [Issue #294](https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/issues/294): Use upstream host name for request

    Add support for a `host=dst` option on the route to trigger fabio to
	use the target hostname for the outgoing request instead of the 
	host name provided by the original request.

 * [Issue #296](https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/issues/296): Sync X-Forwarded-Proto and Forwarded header when possible

   The X-Forwarded-Proto header and the proto value of the Forwarded
   header can get out of sync when an upstream load balancer sets the
   one but not the other header. Fabio would then not touch the existing
   header and derive the value for the unset header based on the
   connection.

   This patch changes this behavior so that the value for the missing
   header is derived from the other one. When both headers are set they are
   both left untouched since it cannot be decided which one is the source
   of truth.

 * [Issue #300](https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/issues/300): Support Gzip encoding for websockets

   Setting the `Accept-Encoding` header to `gzip` and enabling gzip compression
   triggered a bug in fabio which prevented the use of gzip compression on
   websocket connections.

 * [Issue #302](https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/issues/302): Add support for read-only UI

   The `ui.access` parameter can be used to configure the ui endpoint to
   be in either read-write or read-only mode.

 * [Issue #304](https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/issues/304): Add support for X-Forwarded-Prefix header

   The `X-Forwarded-Prefix` header is added when the `strip=/foo` option
   is used on a route and contains the path that was stripped (e.g.
   `/foo`).

### [v1.4.4](https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/releases/tag/v1.4.4) - 8 May 2017

#### Bug Fixes

 * [Issue #271](https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/issues/271): Support websocket for HTTPS upstream
 
   This patch fixes that websocket connections are not forwarded to an HTTPS upstream server.

 * [Issue #279](https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/issues/279): fabio does not start with multiple listeners

   Commit [5a23cb1](https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/commit/5a23cb19dc64a30ee40c42bd3ec1dde289a91033)
   found in [#265](https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/issues/265) added code for
   not swallowing the errors but did not capture the loop variable for the go
   routines when starting listeners. This prevented fabio from starting up
   properly when being configured with more than one listener.

 * [Issue #289](https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/issues/289): Fabio does not advertise http/1.1 on TLS connections
 
   This patch makes fabio announce both `h2` and `http/1.1` as application level protocols
   on TLS connections.

#### Improvements

 * The listener code no longer swallows the errors and exits if it cannot create
   a listening socket.

 * [Issue #278](https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/issues/278): Add service name to access log fields
 
   Add `$upstream_service` which contains the service name of the selected target
   to the available access log fields.

### [v1.4.3](https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/releases/tag/v1.4.3) - 24 Apr 2017

#### Bug Fixes

 * [Issue #269](https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/issues/269): Access log cannot be disabled

   The access logging feature that was added in v1.4.1 did not allow to disable the access logging
   output and all fabio instances were writing an access log by default. Also, the logging setup
   code would leave fabio registered in consul in case of a failure.

#### Improvements

 * [PR #268](https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/pull/268): Add support for TLSSkipVerify for https consul fabio check

   When the fabio admin port is configured to use HTTPS then the consul health check has
   to use HTTPS as well. The new `registry.consul.register.checkTLSSkipVerify` option allows
   to disable TLS certificate validation for this check. This requires consul 0.7.2 or higher.

   Thanks to @Ginja for providing this patch.

 * Demo server supports HTTPS
 
   The `demo/server/server` now supports `https` and `wss` to test the 
   HTTPS upstream support. To run an HTTPS server run the following

   ```shell
   # generate some test certs
   cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/fabiolb/fabio
   build/issue-225-gen-cert.bash

   # build and run the demo server
   cd demo/server
   go build
   ./server -certFile ../cert/server/server-cert.pem -keyFile ../cert/server/server-key.pem -proto https -prefix "/foo tlsskipverify=true"
   ```
   
 * Add route options to UI
 
   The UI now shows the combined options from all targets for a route.

 * Add fabio logo to UI
 
   The Fabio logo is displayed on all UI pages.

### [v1.4.2](https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/releases/tag/v1.4.2) - 10 Apr 2017

The vault tests do not yet pass with vault 0.7.0 and support for vault 0.7.0 has yet to be confirmed.
fabio is known to work with vault 0.6.4.

#### Features

 * [PR #257](https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/pull/257), [Issue #181](https://github.com/eBay/fabio/issues/181): Add HTTPS Upstream Support

   Upstream servers can now be served via HTTPS. To enable this for a route add the `proto=https` option
   to the `urlprefix-` tag. The upstream certificate needs to be in the system certificate chain for the
   certificate validation to succeed. To disable certificate validation for upstream requests add the
   `tlsskipverify=true` option. Support for certificate stores for upstream servers may come at a later
   point.

   Thanks to @shadowfax-chc for providing this patch.

   See: https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/wiki/Features#https-upstream-support

 * [PR #258](https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/pull/258): Allow UI/API to be served over HTTPS

   The UI/API endpoint can now be served via HTTPS. To enable this configure the `ui.addr` property
   with a `cs=<cert store>` option like the `proxy.addr` listeners.

   Thanks to @shadowfax-chc for providing this patch.

#### Improvements

 * Upgrade to go1.8.1
 * Run tests with consul 0.8.0
 * Improve CHANGELOG

### [v1.4.1](https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/releases/tag/v1.4.1) - 4 Apr 2017

#### Features

 * [Issue #80](https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/issues/80): Add support for access logging

   fabio now supports configurable access logging. By default access logging is disabled and can
   be enabled with `log.access.target=stdout`. The default format is the
   [Common Log Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Log_Format) but can be changed
   to either the [Combined Log Format](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/logs.html#combined)
   or a custom log format by setting `log.access.format`

   Thanks to @beyondblog for providing the initial patch.

   See: https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/wiki/Features#access-logging

### [v1.4](https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/releases/tag/v1.4) - 25 Mar 2017

#### Features

 * [Issue #1](https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/issues/1), [Issue #179](https://github.com/eBay/fabio/issues/179): Add generic TCP Proxy support

   fabio now supports raw TCP proxying support by setting the `proto=tcp` option on the
   `urlprefix-` tag. The target needs to be the external port of the service, e.g.
   `urlprefix-:3306` for a MySQL proxy. fabio needs to have a TCP listener configured for
   that port through the `proxy.addr` option, e.g. `proxy.addr=:3306;proto=tcp`.

   The TCP proxy also supports TLS which is configured through the `cs=<cert store>`
   option like the HTTPS listeners.

 * [Issue #163](https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/issues/163): Support glob host matching

   This patch adds support for glob host matching the hostname in routes like
   `urlprefix-*.foo.com/bar`.

#### Improvements

 * Upgrade to Go 1.8 and drop support for Go 1.7

 * [Issue #178](https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/issues/178): Add tests and timeouts to TCP+SNI proxy

   Add full integration tests and support for read/write timeouts through the `rt=` and `wt=`
   options on the listener config for the TCP+SNI proxy. The initial implementation was only
   tested manually.

 * [Issue #248](https://github.com/fabiolb/fabio/issues/248): Start listener after routing table is initialized

   fabio now waits for the first routing table before serving requests. This should remove
   503s during restarts on heavily loaded sites.
